# XKCD Charts

This is a small library to draw charts like XKCD, since it seems to be all the rage at the moment, using SVG. It has no library dependancies. The animation runs well in Chrome, but sucks in Firefox. Forget IE, I did.

![Oh, look! An XKCD like chart](https://img.skitch.com/20121021-f8yqtr6x4be6jcg1kgmwgnkypa.jpg)

Based on the work [here](http://bl.ocks.org/3914862), but heavily modified since, with a smidgen of code copied from [Prototype](http://prototypejs.org). 

## TODO

- Add titles to the axes
- Add arrows to the axes
- Make the pertubations nicer on horizontal lines
- Maybe I should test this... heh
